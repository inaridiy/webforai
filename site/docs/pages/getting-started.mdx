### Load HTML with utilities

Firstly, load HTML using the `loadHtml` utility. Using this function, you can get HTML from a URL in a simple way. It supports versions for **fetch**, **Playwright**, and **Puppeteer**.

:::code-group

```tsx [fetch] twoslash
import { loadHtml } from "webforai/loaders/fetch"; // [!code hl]

// Load html from url
const url = "https://www.npmjs.com/package/webforai";
const html = await loadHtml(url); // [!code hl]
```


```tsx [playwright] twoslash
// Before using playwright loader, run `npx playwright install`
import { loadHtml } from "webforai/loaders/playwright"; // [!code hl]

// Load html from url
const url = "https://www.npmjs.com/package/webforai";
const html = await loadHtml(url , { superBypassMode: true }); // [!code hl] 
// @log: Only playwright loader supports super bypass mode. 
// @log: This is useful to bypass some anti-bot measures.
```

```tsx [puppeteer] twoslash
// Before using puppeteer loader, run `npm i puppeteer`
import { loadHtml } from "webforai/loaders/puppeteer"; // [!code hl]

// Load html from url
const url = "https://www.npmjs.com/package/webforai";
const html = await loadHtml(url); // [!code hl]
```

:::

:::warning
The `loadHtml` function is designed for ease of use and is not recommended for intensive use in production environments.

### Convert HTML to Markdown

Now that you have a Client set up, you can now interact with Ethereum and consume [Actions](/docs/actions/public/introduction)!

```tsx 
import { htmlToMarkdown } from "webforai"; // [!code focus]
import { loadHtml } from "webforai/loaders/fetch";

// Load html from url
const url = "https://www.npmjs.com/package/webforai";
const html = await loadHtml(url); 

const markdown = htmlToMarkdown(html); // [!code focus]
```
