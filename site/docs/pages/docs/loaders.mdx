# Loaders Utilities

The **Loaders Utilities** provide simple tools to easily fetch HTML from websites.  
All the utilities are designed to be straightforward, requiring no configuration. 

:::warning
However, they are not recommended for production use.

## Overview of Loaders

Webforai provides three different loaders:

- **Fetch Loader**: The simplest option, using JavaScript's built-in Fetch API.
- **Playwright Loader**: Ideal for sites requiring JavaScript execution, like SPAs.
- **Puppeteer Loader**: Another option for handling websites with JavaScript execution.

## Fetch Loader

The **Fetch Loader** is the simplest utility, using JavaScriptâ€™s **Fetch API**. 
It retrieves HTML from a given URL, using a basic User-Agent for the request.

### Usage

```ts twoslash
import { loadHtml } from "webforai/loaders/fetch";

const html = await loadHtml("https://example.com");
```

## Playwright Loader

The **Playwright Loader** is a more powerful tool, using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to 
fetch HTML from websites that need JavaScript execution, like SPAs (Single Page Applications).

### Usage

Before using the Playwright Loader, you need to install the Playwright browser and its dependencies.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npx playwright-core install
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install playwright-core
```
:::

And then you can use the Playwright Loader as follows:

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [basic-usage]
import { loadHtml } from "webforai/loaders/playwright";

const html = await loadHtml("https://example.com");
```

```ts twoslash [super-bypass-mode]
import { loadHtml } from "webforai/loaders/playwright";

const html = await loadHtml("https://example.com", {
    superBypassMode: true,
});

```

## Puppeteer Loader

The **Puppeteer Loader** is another advanced tool that uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to 
load HTML from sites that rely on JavaScript execution, similar to Playwright.

### Usage

Before using the Puppeteer Loader, you need to install the Puppeteer browser and its dependencies.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install puppeteer 
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install puppeteer 
```
:::

And then you can use the Puppeteer Loader as follows:

```ts twoslash
import { loadHtml } from "webforai/loaders/puppeteer";

const html = await loadHtml("https://example.com");
```
