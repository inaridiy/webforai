# How it works

## Overview

The core function of webforai is **converting HTML to Markdown**, built on the Syntax Tree ecosystem. This process happens in two steps:

1. **Convert HTML to [Hast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast)**. (Hypertext Abstract Syntax Tree)
2. **Convert Hast to [Mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast)**. (Markdown Abstract Syntax Tree)
3. **Convert Mdast to Markdown**.

What makes this special is the **content extraction** in step 1. This ensures that only the main content—the part humans care about—is extracted from the HTML.   
After that, the rest of the transformation is handled using fine-tuned utilities from the Syntax Tree ecosystem.

## Extractor

In webforai, the process of extracting the main content from a web page is abstracted into a component called the **Extractor**. 
This is a flexible system designed to make content extraction simple and customizable.

### Extractor Interface

The Extractor is a function that takes in two things:

- A **Hast** object, which represents the structure of the HTML.
- Optional metadata, such as the language or URL of the page.

The Extractor processes this input and returns a new Hast object that represents the cleaned-up, extracted content.

```ts twoslash
import type { Nodes as Hast } from "hast";

type ExtractParams = { hast: Hast; lang?: string; url?: string };
type Extractor = (params: ExtractParams) => Hast;
```

### Default Extractor

By default, webforai provides a built-in Extractor called `takumi-extractor`. This extractor is adjusted to produce a high average quality for a typical web page.
I do my best to adjust it to the best of my ability using various flags and scoring with reference to **Mozilla's readability** and other algorithms.

### Customizing the Extraction

**webforai** allows you to define **multiple extractors** and chain them together. 
The Hast object is passed from one Extractor to the next in the order they are defined, allowing you to fine-tune the extraction process.

You can also create **your own custom Extractor** to implement specific algorithms or extraction logic.

```ts
import { htmlToMarkdown } from "webforai";
import type { Extractor } from "webforai";

const customExtractor: Extractor = (params) => {
  const { hast, url } = params;
  // Your custom extraction logic here
  return hast;
};

const Markdown = await htmlToMarkdown(html, {
  extractors: [customExtractor],
});
```
